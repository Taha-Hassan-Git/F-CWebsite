                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm Taha Hassan, an EFL teacher and aspiring front end developer. I always have a hobby or project on the go and it usually involves making something. Some of my interests include:  music, 3D animation, activism, film, martial arts, languages/translation and, of course, software development.
                </p>
                <p>I've thrown myself at a lot of things over the years so I've had to pick up new skills a lot. I've become acutely aware of the unimportance of natural talent, and the corresponding importance of practice. Just getting the repetitons in until it becomes embodied.</p>

                    <h1>Application Projects</h1>
                    <p>Here are the projects I completed for the application. I learned a lot while working through the projects. I found each one was just perfectly out of my reach at the time that I attempted it, which lead me to learn new skills. The Hobby Page was the first website I had ever made at that point. By the time I finished it I had learned enough to be able to begin the next project. As I look through them all now it's amazing to see my progress. I would have liked to have had more time to redo some of the old projects with my new skills, but I've only managed a few touch ups.</p>

                    <h1>Why I'm Applying</h1>
                    <p>I've been looking to move out of EFL teaching for a while, the pandemic really highlighted to be how unstable that kind of work is in this country. I've had some prior experience with programming, python in particular and I've always been interested in getting into software development, specifically app development. I've had an idea for an app I want to make that I think would be quite simple, but it doesn't exist yet. I would like to make an app that does a little hearing test and then EQs all of the audio going out of your device to compensate for any hearing loss. It would allow users to lower the overall volume of their devices and protect their hearing for longer.</p>
                    <p>A couple of friends of mine have done the Founders and Coders bootcamp (I don't think it was an apprenticeship at the time) and were successful in finding great jobs afterwards so I was encouraged to apply. From what I've seen of Founders and Coders so far, I've been very impressed. I think you put a lot of care and thought into every stage of the application process, I was quite touched to be asked about my access needs and contacted ahead of time to clarify how best to support me. I think you guys seem to value the same sorts of things that I value: a community spirit, a safe and welcoming space and a diverse group of perspectives. I hope it's something I can contribute to one day.</p>

                    <p>Below is some information on my various hobbies and the things I've managed to achieve in them. It's a real patchwork quilt!</p>

                    <p>I've been a band member of Screaming Toenail a queer decolonial punk band. I play guitar, sometimes bass and help write songs. In the time I've played for them we've released an album, we've done a short UK tour and we've played in international music festivals along with acts such as Mykki Blanco.
                    <p>I've also been commisioned to compose music for a podcast, a short film and a radioplay.</p>
